# WikiFlight

**WikiFlight** is a small Windows application that connects to MS Flight Simulator 2020. While connected to it, it displays pages from Wikipedia about things nearby your aircraft.

No installation is required to run **WikiFlight**.

## How to build

Just open WikiFlight.sln in Visual Studio (tested with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10).
